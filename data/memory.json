Some of the important points were: checking weather and drought conditions, choosing an open location for a campfire, ensuring the campfire is completely extinguished, keeping vehicles off dry grass, never leaving a campfire unattended, not throwing cigarettes or other smoking materials on the ground, keeping sparks away from dry vegetation, and calling 000 for any emergency."
